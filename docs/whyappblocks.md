# Why use AppBlocks?

Most modern front-end libraries/frameworks such as Vue, React and Angular are well-suited for building complex, scalable
and maintainable applications if you know how to use them. There is no doupt that they are battle tested, production-ready
libraries/frameworks. So you propably want to know where AppBlocks shines and how it can help you in developing your
front-end more efficiently.

## So why you should choose AppBlocks?

In one sentence: **AppBlocks has a very low memory footprint and is very easy to intergrate in any project.**

The goal of AppBlocks is to provide all the necessary functionality for developing small-scale front-end apps without 
introducing much overhead. It is tiny **(~4.5kB minified)**, simple and practical. It is also very easy to intergrate
in your project and start using it. All you need to do is to include AppBlocks as a script tag on any page and you're
good to go.

That beeing said, AppBlocks is not meant for building large-scale applications. It does not include a router or a
sophisticated state management system. This field is already covered by many well known frameworks and libraries so 
there is no point of introducing another javascript library that does the same thing.

AppBlocks is for developing small applications fast and easy.

What AppBlocks provides out of the box is this:
- Control the structure of your application with an easy to use template syntax.
- Template placeholders.
- Template directives.
- Methods handling.
- Event handling.
- Make requests that affect your App's state with [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

Here's a comparison of the size of other javascript libraries/frameworks:

Name	| Size
--|--
Vue 2.6.11 | 63.5kB
React-dom 16.13.1 | 114.6kB
Angular 1.7.9 | 179.5kB
Inferno 7.4.2 | 21.2kB
PReact 10.4.1 | 9.8kB
**AppBlocks 1.2.2** | **4.5kB**

So if you start building an application do consider of giving AppBlocks a try and see how much value you can get out of
a 4kB library.
