# AppBlocks

> A lightweight javascript library for building micro apps for the front-end. 

Appblocks is simple and lightweight (~5kb minified), easy to use and master, covers the most common use cases for the 
front-end and plays nice with server side template engines such as Django templates and Jinja2.
